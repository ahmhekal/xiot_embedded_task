Aduino Task for XIOT
=============================

- This is an arduino project that uses one digital output (digital pin 1) as a led which has two states (ON - OFF)
- The lighting of the led is controlled by digital input (digital pin 2) which is a switch. when it is pressed the state of the led chenges
- If the switch pressed we send “pressed” to the serial monitor only one time also send the LED states ”ON” or “OFF”
- in parallel, the program send continuous serial data comes from temperature sensor with 3 second rate. we connect the temprature sensor (lm35) to analog pin 1.
